            %dt How do I cite DoCM?
            %dd 
              A manuscript for DoCM is currently in preparation. In the mean time please 
              cite http://docm.genome.wustl.edu

            %dt How do I use the DoCM API?
            %dd 
              The API can be queried using HTTP requests. More information can be 
              found at our #{link_to 'API Documentation', '/api'} page

            %dt How often is DoCM updated?
            %dd 
              DoCM is updated as new curated lists and variants are brought
              to our attention. If you think we are missing a variant or need to 
              update a record, #{link_to 'please submit your query', '/variant_submission'}.

            %dt How do I download DoCM variants?
            %dd 
              You can download variants via the #{link_to 'API', '/api'}, or you can
              use the TSV or VCF buttons on the main page. These will be filtered 
              according to the criteria that you specify (i.e. chromosome, disease, etc).
              The TSV button will download a tab separated values file. The VCF button will
              download a variant call format file.
