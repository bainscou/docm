            About
          %p.lead
            DoCM, the Database of Curated Mutations, is a highly curated database of known,
            disease-causing mutations that provides easily explorable variant lists with direct links to source
            citations for easy verification.

            DoCM Principles
          %p
            %ul
              %li  Highly curated lists of disease-causing mutations enable researchers and clinicians to foster collaboration and elucidate the state of the art of pathogenic variation.
              %li  A central public repository of pathogenic mutations allows for more comprehensive curation of the literature and eliminates duplication of curation effort.
              %li  To promote DoCM's utility as well as collaboration between clinicians, researchers and industry DoCM's content is openly licensed under a Creative Commons license (#{link_to 'CC BY 4.0', 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/'}), require attribution given to the community that created the content.
              %li  No fees or exclusive access will be introduced.
              %li  DoCM will preserve previous versions of the database allowing a static snapshot of the database.

            DoCM Purpose
          %p
            %q
              DoCM serves as an accessible, open-source, and openly licensed somatic mutation repository that also
              enables community contributions. Curation of the literature to produce a high quality set of pathogenic
              somatic mutations is not trival. Sifting through the ever growing body of cancer research literature
              (6% growth rate in the last 10 years), with over 150,000 articles
              #{link_to 'related to cancer indexed by PubMed', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cancer'} last year, makes it difficult to identify bona fide somatic mutations with characterized functional or clinical significance in cancer. Once identified, these mutations require significant curation efforts to format and standardize the mutations in a consistent way that enables databasing. For example, publications often only specify the amino acid change and gene name to describe the mutation.
